<h4 align="center">Inferential Statistics and Data Visualization project to find out which factor affects employee satisfaction in a company.</h4>


# Preface
The author is an HR Consultant working in a project for Celerium. Celerium had done their own research on company performance, and is now interested in increasing employee satisfaction to increase company performance.

Celerium asks 3 things:
1. What are the top three factors that affect employee satisfaction in Celerium? How do those factors affect employee satisfaction?
2. Who are the employees that are least satisfied in Celerium?
3. How does salary play a role in employee satisfaction in Celerium?

The data is of survey done by the author and Celerium (data is obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redpen12/employees-satisfaction-analysis/)

# Data Analysis and Visualization

Upon Exploratory Data Analysis, the author found out of the data skewness, hence non-parametric measures were used to detect causality between the factors and employee satisfaction. The method used were Chi-Square, and data were then grouped to easily understandable groups. 

The discovery is that most of the factors in the survey data was determined to be significant to employee satisfaction, so the author decided to look into the patterns between each employee satisfaction group with their respective factor.

The most contrast difference, however, are seen on:
- Number of projects handled at once
- Average working hours
- Promotion
  
The contrasts and other discoveries can be seen on the dashboard [here.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ade.william.tabrani/viz/EmployeeSatisfactionProject/EmployeeSatisfactionProjectAdeWT#1)

# Post-Data Analysis and Visualization

Report were then made with all the relevant results and insights. You can see the report [here.](https://github.com/AdeWT/Employee-Satisfaction-Project-AdeWT/blob/main/ESP_presentation_slides.pdf)
